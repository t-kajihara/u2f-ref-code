# Reference code for U2F specifications

This code implements the FIDO U2F specifications being developed at
http://fidoalliance.org/.  This code is intended as a reference and resource
for developers who are interested in exploring U2F.  The code consists of the
following components:

## Java U2F implementation

This code can verify U2F registrations and signatures. A web application built
to accept U2F 2nd factor is built on top of a code base such as this. The code
base includes a trivial web application so the user can experiment with
registration and signatures (also see the sample web app below).

## A virtual (software) U2F device

This is a Java implementation of a U2F device. It generates registration and
signature statements and is meant for testing against your server
implementation. A physical U2F device will generate similar statements.

## A sample web app that uses U2F

This is a sample application built on the Google App Engine web platform which
demonstrates a possible UX for  user interaction with U2F in a web page.  The
sample application is deployed and available live at
https://crxjs-dot-u2fdemo.appspot.com/. The underlying U2F capability is provided by the
Java U2F implementation.  A developer can take the core ideas from here and
integrate U2F into a web application on their own favorite web app platform.

## A U2F extension for the Chrome browser

This extension brings U2F capability to the Chrome browser. A web application
is able to access USB U2F devices using the U2F API provided by this extension.
The extension is [available from the Chrome store][webstore] for direct use.
The source is available in ``u2f-chrome-extension`` for experimentation, see
[the extension README](u2f-chrome-extension/README.md) for details.

To experience the end-to-end user experience you will need to get a physical
USB device since the virtual device *does not* simulate the USB layer at this
time. You can visit https://goo.gl/z0taoW to find FIDO U2F compliant devices
available for sale.

## Getting started

u2f-ref-code is a self contained java project that includes a basic web server
and includes packages for all crypto, utilities, etc.  It does *not* need to run
in a container or application server like Tomcat.  To run the demo server, run
the main class in ``com.google.u2f.tools.httpserver.U2fHttpServer``

To compile and run the server in Eclipse, import the Maven project into your
workspace. You may need to fix the classpath if your version of JDK is
different (this has been tested with Java 1.7).  The simple demo web server is
in ``com.google.u2f.tools.httpserver.U2fHttpServer.java`` and runs on port
8080. Run this class as a regular Java application (right click, select *Run
As* and *Java Application*). Note that you need to have the U2F extension
installed in Chrome in order for the demo app to talk to your U2F token.

To run directly with Maven, run `mvn compile exec:java` from the u2f-ref-code
directory.

### U2F-GAE-Demo

The u2f-gae-demo project is a sample application built on the Google App Engine
web platform which demonstrates a possible UX for user interaction with U2F in a
web page.

To start the development server with Maven, run `mvn appengine:devserver`. This
will run the server locally at `http://localhost:8888/`.

As above, if importing the Maven project into Eclipse you might have to adjust
JDK versions, App Engine SDK version, etc. Once everything compiles, you can run
the App Engine server locally and point Google Chrome at `http://localhost:8888/`.

The built-in support for U2F in Google Chrome only works on HTTPS sites.  To test
the app on `http://localhost:8888`, which uses HTTP, you need to do one of the
following:

#### Option 1: Use the extension from the webstore
* Install the u2f extension [available from the Chrome store][webstore].
* Navigate to `chrome://extensions` and enable `Developer Mode` by clicking a
  checkbox in the top right corner.
* Find the `FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor)` extension.
* Click on "background page". This will open a Developer Tools window, including
  a Console.
* In the console, type:

        HTTP_ORIGINS_ALLOWED = true;
* Now, configure the appspot server to call the U2F extension by setting the
  extension id in
  [u2f-api.js](https://github.com/google/u2f-ref-code/blob/master/u2f-gae-demo/war/js/u2f-api.js)
  to ```kmendfapggjehodndflmmgagdbamhnfd```:
```
  u2f.EXTENSION_ID = 'kmendfapggjehodndflmmgagdbamhnfd';
```
  Remember to reset this value before deploying.
* Then, point your browser at `http://localhost:8888/`.

#### Option 2: Use the built-in chrome support
* Quit all instances of Google Chrome.
* Restart Google Chrome with the `--show-component-extension-options`
  command-line flag.
* Navigate to `chrome://extensions` and enable `Developer Mode` by clicking a
  checkbox in the top right corner.
* Find the `CryptoTokenExtension` extension.
* Click on "background page". This will open a Developer Tools window, including
  a Console.

* In the console, type:

        HTTP_ORIGINS_ALLOWED = true;
* Then, point your browser at http://localhost:8888/

You can deploy this App Engine app to your own domain by changing the application
name in `u2f-gae-demo/war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml`.
